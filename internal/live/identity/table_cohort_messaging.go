// identityTableMessaging is the messaging cohort's slice of [DefaultTable]:
// the identity rows the messaging ratification batch added. Registered into
// DefaultTable by init below; see contributing/LIVE-TABLES.md.
var identityTableMessaging = buildTable(
	// ---- Registry-ratified (#40, #44): third batch, messaging (SQS, SNS
	// ---- beyond the already-admitted aws_sns_topic, CloudWatch, and
	// ---- EventBridge/Events) -------------------------------------------
	//
	// Same pipeline as the Lambda batch above: every row started as a
	// tools/row-gen proposal from live/registry.json, cross-checked against
	// the AWS provider's documented import behaviour (its "Import" section,
	// fetched from the provider's own website/docs/r/ source at the pinned
	// v6.58.0 tag) rather than accepted on the registry's word alone. Most
	// of the Logs and Events resource family carries no cfn_type in
	// live/mapping.json at all — aws_cloudwatch_log_stream,
	// aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter, aws_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter,
	// aws_cloudwatch_event_bus, aws_cloudwatch_event_target and the rest —
	// so row-gen proposes nothing for them; this batch's Logs and Events
	// slice is only the two types the registry does map,
	// aws_cloudwatch_log_group (already admitted, client-named cohort
	// above) and aws_cloudwatch_event_rule (proposed, rejected below).
	// Cohort estate: live/e2e/estates/messaging.
	//
	// Rejected, and deliberately absent from this table:
	//
	//   - aws_cloudwatch_alarm_mute_rule: row-gen proposed server-assigned
	//     via the registry's Arn (read-only; Name is createOnlyProperties
	//     only). The provider disagrees: both its documented import
	//     command and its identity schema's sole required_for_import
	//     attribute are the rule's own name argument, already in
	//     configuration — a name-composed ID the registry's own read-only
	//     field does not name. Same failure shape as the Lambda batch's
	//     aws_lambda_alias.
	//   - aws_cloudwatch_event_rule: row-gen proposed server-assigned via
	//     the registry's Arn, AWS::Events::Rule's sole readOnlyProperty.
	//     The provider disagrees: the documented import ID is
	//     "event_bus_name/rule_name", a composite of two configured
	//     arguments (event_bus_name silently defaulting to the account's
	//     default bus when omitted from configuration) — live/SURVEY.md's
	//     own curated-68 row already named this exact grammar. Wiring it
	//     needs a component this table's vocabulary does not have yet (a
	//     literal fallback for an omitted argument, not just a separator),
	//     so it stays a "needs hand separator" case rather than a guess
	//     this batch writes blind, the same stance as the Lambda batch's
	//     two rejections.
	//
	// Deferred, for a reason that is not about identity at all:
	//
	//   - aws_sns_topic_subscription: row-gen proposed server-assigned via
	//     the registry's Arn, and the provider agrees — SNS mints the
	//     subscription's own ARN (the parent topic's ARN plus a UUID) only
	//     once the subscription confirms, and live/SURVEY.md's own
	//     curated-68 row already reaches the same "ready" verdict by hand.
	//     It is left out of this table anyway: the type carries no tags
	//     argument, it is one of live/survey.json's curated 68 rows, and
	//     admitting an untaggable curated-68 type obligates
	//     live/LIMITATIONS.md's "Untaggable types cannot be removed by the
	//     sweep" entry (tools/survey-gen/limitations_test.go derives that
	//     entry's roster mechanically from the survey intersected with the
	//     admission table). Editing live/LIMITATIONS.md or the curated-68
	//     apparatus is out of scope for this batch — see
	//     live/e2e/estates/messaging/README.md and issue #54. The Lambda
	//     batch's aws_lambda_layer_version did not hit this wall only
	//     because it sits outside the curated 68, where
	//     internal/live/stamp/stamp_test.go's untaggableOutsideCuratedSurvey
	//     list, not the doc, is where its untaggability is pinned.
