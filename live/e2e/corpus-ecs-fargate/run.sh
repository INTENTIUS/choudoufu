# terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ecs's flagship "fargate" example
# (.corpus/ecs/examples/fargate, pinned in live/corpus-manifest.json at tag
# v7.6.0, commit c83279b39). Fargate is the most common modern way people
# run ECS (the module's other example, ec2-autoscaling, is the older
# launch type and is not this crossing's target), and this module is the
# de facto standard way people provision it. It had never been crossed
# against a cloud before this script existed.
#
# 62 real resources: an ECS cluster (Container Insights + a FARGATE/
# FARGATE_SPOT default capacity-provider split), an ECS service behind an
# ALB with a BLUE_GREEN deployment_configuration, ECS Exec
# (enable_execute_command), ECS Service Connect, a two-container task
# definition (a "fluent-bit" firelens sidecar reading its image from a
# public AWS-managed SSM parameter, plus the app container), a second,
# standalone task definition (no service) with a volume and an ARM64
# runtime platform, a CloudMap HTTP namespace, an ALB module (2 target
# groups, blue/green listener rules), and a VPC module underneath it all.
#
# ONE EMULATOR-GAP WORKAROUND, not a config edit (DELTA 2 below): floci does
# not mirror AWS's own published SSM parameter catalog (the same class of
# gap floci-io/floci's AMI-catalog fixes address for EC2/EKS/sumaform, just
# not extended to SSM). `data.aws_ssm_parameter.fluentbit` reads
# `/aws/service/aws-for-fluent-bit/stable`, a real parameter AWS itself
# publishes with a real value in production - it is seeded via the AWS CLI
# before stage 1's apply, not edited out of the configuration or worked
# around with a variable.
#
# STAGE-BY-STAGE SHAPE (issue #274's five-stage pipeline):
#
#   1. COLD DEPLOY   plain `terraform apply` (real HashiCorp terraform, not
#                     choudoufu), no live block. PASS: a single, clean
#                     apply, 62 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
#   2. MIGRATE       `choudoufu live-import -state=<plain's state>
#                     -estate=... -approve`. PASS: 46 of 62 instances
#                     eligible (28 VERIFIED + 18 DRIFTED), 16 correctly
#                     skipped (all 16 UNTAGGABLE by provider schema; #305's
#                     default_* trio is admitted now and stamps cleanly - 2
#                     VERIFIED + 1 DRIFTED, see below), 0 failed. Two
#                     markers - the ECS cluster's and the ECS service's own
#                     - confirmed independently through the AWS CLI.
#   3. TEST PLAN     delete the state file, `choudoufu live-plan`. BLOCKED
#                     for real by one tracked, itemized gap: #308 (1 site).
#                     See below.
#   4. TEST APPLY    NOT RUN - depends on stage 3.
#   5. DRIFT/RECONVERGE  NOT RUN - depends on stages 3-4.
#
# #305 (admission: aws_default_network_acl/aws_default_route_table/
# aws_default_security_group were unadmitted) is FIXED. This module's VPC
# submodule adopts the account's default objects
# (manage_default_network_acl/route_table/security_group, all true by
# default), exactly as it does for most of its users. Re-verified against
# this estate below: all three now resolve through their own tofu-address
# marker and stamp in stage 2 (2 VERIFIED, 1 DRIFTED on genuine default-ACL
# drift - subnet_ids/egress/ingress, the same shape found in corpus-
# security-group-complete), and stage 3's live-plan contributes zero
# unadmitted-type refusals from them, asserted directly below rather than
# merely dropped from the old assertion.
#
# #313 DOES NOT REACH THIS ESTATE - CHECKED, NOT ASSUMED. #313 (a
# `data.aws_availability_zones` for-comprehension feeding per-AZ for_each
# in a nested module call, "Unable to use data.aws_availability_zones.
# available in static context") was filed crossing corpus-security-group-
# complete, whose vpc submodule reads the same data source the same way
# this estate's main.tf line 5-18 does (`local.azs = slice(data.aws_
# availability_zones.available.names, 0, 3)`, fed to `module "vpc"` as
# `azs = local.azs`). The difference is what the vpc submodule does with
# it downstream: this pinned vpc module version (v6.x, .terraform/modules/
# vpc/main.tf) expands every subnet resource with `count`, not `for_each`,
# and every count expression is a statically-computable LENGTH
# (`local.len_private_subnets`, `length(var.azs)`, ...) - never the AZ
# VALUES themselves as map keys. A live-plan run below shows no `Unable to
# use data.aws_availability_zones` diagnostic anywhere in this estate's
# output; asserted directly, not by omission, so a regression that makes
# #313 reach here too - e.g. a vpc module bump that switches subnets to
# for_each - is caught rather than passing silently.
#
# WHY THE DRIFTED (18) BUCKET IS LARGE, AND WHY IT DOES NOT BLOCK STAGE 2:
# live-import tolerates drift by design (it stamps DRIFTED resources same
# as VERIFIED ones - drift is reported, not refused). Several of these 18
# are real floci round-trip gaps, found by this crossing and filed against
# the emulator, not against choudoufu: floci-io/floci (lex00 fork) #59
# (ECS CreateCluster silently drops `settings` - Container Insights never
# comes back on describe/list, though it was genuinely applied - and
# `aws_ecs_cluster_capacity_providers`' `default_capacity_provider_strategy`
# is stored but never serialized in any cluster response) and #60 (ECS
# CreateService/DescribeServices drop `scheduling_strategy`,
# `enable_ecs_managed_tags`, `enable_execute_command`,
# `health_check_grace_period_seconds`, `deployment_controller`, the
# blue-green `load_balancer.advanced_configuration`, and
# `service_connect_configuration` entirely - `scheduling_strategy` in
# particular forces the AWS provider to propose destroying and recreating
# the service on every plan after creation, independent of choudoufu).
# Neither blocks this script: DRIFTED still stamps, and stage 3 refuses
# before ever reaching a diff that would show them.
#
# STAGE 3'S ONE REMAINING BLOCKER, real, itemized, asserted below by exact
# rule and exact site:
#
#   #308 (child-module for_each: a for-comprehension over a var-chased map
#   value refuses even when only its keys and filter are static - filed by
#   this crossing, still open). modules/service/main.tf:872:
#
#     for_each = { for k, v in var.container_definitions : k => v if local.create_task_definition && v.create }
#
#   var.container_definitions is supplied by the caller as an object
#   literal whose KEYS are fully static ("fluent-bit", local.container_name)
#   and whose filter (v.create) never touches the one dynamic VALUE in the
#   set (fluent-bit's image, sourced from the SSM parameter data source) -
#   but the walker evaluates the whole expression as a unit and refuses on
#   that unrelated value. Two compounding gaps, both detailed in the issue:
#   the child-module keyset prover has no for-comprehension case at all
#   (unlike resolve.go's resource-level prover, which already has one), and
#   it does not chase a bare var.X reference across a module-call boundary
#   to the literal object constructor that actually has the provable keys.
#   1 site: module.ecs_service, module "container_definition".
#
# BREAK=1 corrupts the expected stage-3 site counts (one unadmitted-type
# site that should not exist, plus a second, wrong child-module for_each
# site), proving those assertions are load-bearing rather than a grep that
# always matches - same discipline as the RDS and security-group crossings
# before this one. Stages 1 and 2 are unaffected.
#
#   bash live/e2e/corpus-ecs-fargate/run.sh
#
# Needs Docker, the AWS CLI, and the real `terraform` binary on PATH for
# stage 1, and .corpus populated (`just corpus-fetch`).
#
# Env overrides:
#   TOFU_BIN     path to a prebuilt choudoufu binary; skips the `go build`.
#   FLOCI_PORT   host port for the emulator (default 4790, clear of every
#                other live/e2e fixture's port).
#   FLOCI_IMAGE  the emulator image; defaults to the digest pin in
#                live/floci-image.
#   BREAK        set to 1 to corrupt the expected stage-3 site counts and
#                one expected unadmitted-type name.
#
# The corpus checkout is shared across worktrees and is NEVER written to:
# the estate is copied out first (twice - once for the cold, unmarked
# deploy, once for the migration attempt) and every delta lands on a copy.
